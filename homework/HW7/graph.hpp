// graph.hpp
// Bryce Melegari
// defines the dagraph object, which represents a directed, acyclic
// graph stored as either an adjacency list or matrix, with the capability
// to convert between the two.

// usage: dagraph d(storageType), where storageType is 0 for an adjacency list,
// or 1 for an adjacency matrix. Defaults to adjacency list on invalid parameter.
